### Competition Diary

#### Day 1
- Finished the core game: bombs, rockets and explosions 💥

#### Day 2
- Added an *explosion sound*. I searched high and low and finally discovered [lowpass filter and ramp](https://bacionejs.github.io/explosion) 🕵️‍♂️

#### Day 3
- Added a 🛸 with a grinning alien that drops fast bombs. My testers didn't like it and I wasn't motivated to fix it since I preferred the previous simplicity, so... 🗑️

#### Day 4
- Added *health and ammo bars* 🚥
- Added a [logarithmic curve-fitting algorithm](https://bacionejs.github.io/difficultyalgorithm) for *level difficulty* 📈

#### Day 5
- Added *text-to-speech* (TTS) phrases 🗣️

#### Day 6
- Added a random *fast level* to break up the monotony 🤪

#### Day 7
- Chose a name for the game, made a *youtube video*, and... 🚀

## Summary
Making this game was 🥳

I learned how to use *sin, cos, PI, hypot, atan2, pow, lowpass, ramp, tts and curve-fitting* 📚


Graphics and sound were *procedurally generated*. For more examples, see [Bacione JavaScript Editor](https://github.com/bacionejs/editor) 🫦
