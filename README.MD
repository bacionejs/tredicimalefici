### Competition Diary

#### Day 1
- Finished the core game: bombs, rockets and explosions 💥

#### Day 2
- Added *linger and fade* to explosions
- Added *sounds*. I already had a rocket sound from my Marslander game, but I needed an *explosion* sound. I searched for an explosion sound algorithm but wasn't satisfied with what I found. Finally, I discovered that simply adding a [lowpass filter and ramp](https://bacionejs.github.io/explosion) to my existing rocket sound did the trick 🕵️‍♂️ 🎉

#### Day 3
Added a boss 👾 -- a UFO with a grinning alien that drops fast bombs. My family didn't like the UFO, especially the grinning alien. I wasn't motivated to fix it since I preferred the previous simplicity, so I removed it 😔

#### Day 4
- Added health and ammo *graphical bars* 🚥
- Added a [logarithmic curve-fitting algorithm](https://bacionejs.github.io/difficultyalgorithm) for level difficulty 🤓

#### Day 5
- Added *text-to-speech* (TTS) phrases 🗣️

#### Day 6
- Added a random *fast level* to break up the monotony 💤

#### Day 7
- Chose a name for the game, made a *youtube video*, and called it a wrap 🚀

## Summary
It was fun making this game 🥳

I learned how to use *sin, cos, PI, hypot, atan2, pow, lowpass, ramp, tts and curve-fitting* 📚


Graphics and sound were *procedurally generated*. For more examples, see [Bacione JavaScript Editor](https://github.com/bacionejs/editor) 🛸
